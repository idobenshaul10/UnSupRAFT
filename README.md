# UnSupRAFT
Unsupervised RAFT  variant for optimal flow 
=======

This repository is based on the code from: RAFT(https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT)

[RAFT: Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms for Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12039.pdf)<br/>
ECCV 2020 <br/>
Zachary Teed and Jia Deng<br/>

The code also contains parts based on: [ARFlow](https://github.com/lliuz/ARFlow), [Unsupervised-Optical-Flow](https://github.com/ily-R/Unsupervised-Optical-Flow), [UnFlow](https://github.com/simonmeister/UnFlow)

To run, the same command as in the RAFT reference are used. UMAP visualization of features are given in `viz_features.py`.
